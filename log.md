### Day 1: January 1 2024, Monday

**Today**: reaquainting myself with where i am in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I gotta stop trying to charge ahead. Nail the basics, stay focused.

### Day 2: January 2 2024, Tuesday

** Today**: Figured out how to fork on the iOs app: you can't! had to open in Chrome, fork and return to the app. not too messy.

**Thoughts**: Day 2 and its already hard to find time. A solid hour might be tricky, might need to concider two 30mins or even three 20min chunks.

### Day 3: January 3 2024, Wednesday

**Today**: very busy day at work. I worked on Java on Sololearn instead of FCC.

**Thoughts**: I should use Sololearn for days like this, when I'm having to snatch moments here and there during the day. FCC needs time to focus.
