### Day 1: January 1 2024, Monday

**Today**: reaquainting myself with where i am in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I gotta stop trying to charge ahead. Nail the basics, stay focused.

### Day 2: January 2 2024, Tuesday

** Today**: Figured out how to fork on the iOs app: you can't! had to open in Chrome, fork and return to the app. not too messy.

**Thoughts**: Day 2 and its already hard to find time. A solid hour might be tricky, might need to concider two 30mins or even three 20min chunks.

### Day 3: January 3 2024, Wednesday

**Today**: very busy day at work. I worked on Java on Sololearn instead of FCC.

**Thoughts**: I should use Sololearn for days like this, when I'm having to snatch moments here and there during the day. FCC needs time to focus. 

### Day 4: January 4 2024, Thursday

**Today**: worked on Sololearn, Java course.

**Thoughts**: Does Sololearn count? It's coding practice but it doesn't feel like I'm working on a 'project'.

### Day 5: January 5 2024, Friday

**Today**: Lil' bit o' SL, lil' bit o' FCC and a very good email.

**Thoughts**: Today there was an alignment of stars. The FCC email lands, I have a read and it talks about a bootcamp that is based on the FCC curriculum AND 100 days of code! It's meant to be. Gonna really try to follow this bootcamp. Its free, it's self driven but it's simply too good an opportunity to let pass.

### Day 6: January 6 2024, Saturday

**Today**: Sololearn, Java. Java bakes my brain but it satisfying when I get it to work.

**Thoughts**: Really hard to find time to code when I'm at home. Really just snatching chances when I can.
