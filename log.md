### Day 1: January 1 2024, Monday

**Today**: reaquainting myself with where i am in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I gotta stop trying to charge ahead. Nail the basics, stay focused.

### Day 2: January 2 2024, Tuesday

** Today**: Figured out how to fork on the iOs app: you can't! had to open in Chrome, fork and return to the app. not too messy.

**Thoughts**: Day 2 and its already hard to find time. A solid hour might be tricky, might need to concider two 30mins or even three 20min chunks.

### Day 3: January 3 2024, Wednesday

**Today**: very busy day at work. I worked on Java on Sololearn instead of FCC.

**Thoughts**: I should use Sololearn for days like this, when I'm having to snatch moments here and there during the day. FCC needs time to focus. 

### Day 4: January 4 2024, Thursday

**Today**: worked on Sololearn, Java course.

**Thoughts**: Does Sololearn count? It's coding practice but it doesn't feel like I'm working on a 'project'.

### Day 5: January 5 2024, Friday

**Today**: Lil' bit o' SL, lil' bit o' FCC and a very good email.

**Thoughts**: Today there was an alignment of stars. The FCC email lands, I have a read and it talks about a bootcamp that is based on the FCC curriculum AND 100 days of code! It's meant to be. Gonna really try to follow this bootcamp. Its free, it's self driven but it's simply too good an opportunity to let pass.

### Day 6: January 6 2024, Saturday

**Today**: Sololearn, Java. Java bakes my brain but it satisfying when I get it to work.

**Thoughts**: Really hard to find time to code when I'm at home. Really just snatching chances when I can.

### Day 7: January 7 2024, Sunday

**Today**: More SL Java. BWC bootcamp intro tonight at 7pm. 

**Thoughts**: SL Java isn't helping me. Its interesting, sure, but it's taking my focus away from what I'm actually focusing on at this stage which is web dev.

### Day 8: January 8 2024, Monday

**Today**: SL HTML. BWC first bootcamp stream. 

**Thoughts**: Java set to the side. Turns out I'd already started HTML on SL ages ago and I'd forgotten. 

### Day 9: January 9 2024, Tuesday

**Today**: Finished the SL HTML course.  

**Thoughts**: Was able to get through the HTML course quickly. Most of it I had covered i FCC so it was a refresher at most. I'll do the SL CSS course next.

### Day 10: January 10 2024, Wednesday

**Today**: SL CSS

**Thoughts**: Struggling to fit BWC bootcamp into my day. 7pm is right at bedtime for the kids. Watching them back after the live feed isn't the same. They haven't reached the point I'm at in FCC so I'm keeping on with SL in the meantime.

### Day 11: January 11 2024, Thursday

**Today**: SL CSS. 

**Thoughts**: SL gives a very high level viewpoint which is good at the moment. It's giving me info in a different format to FCC and I think it's helping solidify info.

### Day 12: January 12 2024, Friday

**Today**: Completed the SL CSS course. Dipped a toe into JavaScript. 

**Thoughts**: So I kinda just dodged work in the afternoon to power through the CSS course. Completed it (yay!) and it was a nice way to tie off the week. Next I'll try JavaScript.

### Day 13: January 13 2024, Saturday

**Today**: Work day today. Managed a lot of FCC during the quieter moments. It's making a lot more sense after the SL work.

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 14: January 14 2024, Sunday

**Today**: (17/1/24) absolutely floored by a flu bug. slept all day. 

**Thoughts**: 14 days in and life sticks the boot in. No coding today. I'll do an extra day at the end to make up.

### Day 15: January 15 2024, Monday

**Today**: (17/1/24) flu. doc signed me off for the week. little bit of SL JS.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 16: January 16 2024, Tuesday

**Today**: (17/1/24) SL JS for about 30 mins was all my brain could handle.

**Thoughts**: Managed to get a little done which felt good.

### Day 17: January 17 2024, Wednesday

**Today**: Feeling a bit more human today.
